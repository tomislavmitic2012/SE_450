(-1) Many of your methods in this part accept parameters, but you are directly using those parameters without
checking them. As a result, your application can easily crash if invalid or null data were passed into your
methods.

FYI - you have a javadoc warning:

DepaulStockExchange\src\tradeprocessing\productbook\ProductBookSide.java:294: warning - @return tag cannot be used in method with void return type.

Otherwise, no issues. Good job!
