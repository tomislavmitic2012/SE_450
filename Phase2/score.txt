16 of 15 (Extra point for use of delegation)

FYI - If you are using delegation in your classes (to the TradableImpl) you should NOT hard-code the TradableImpl name in your Order and QuoteSide.
You are hard-coded to one kind of delegate as a result. Use a factory that returns Tradable object.

FYI - All data members should have "set" methods (modifiers) that error check the value, throw a custom exception if the value is unacceptable,
then otherwise they set the data member to the new value. These should only be public if the application requires it, otherwise they should
remain private. All constructors should rely on their data member's "set" methods to do the data member assignments.
Error checking and assignments should not appear in a constructor. This should be fixed by Phase 3 or points might be lost.

FYI - You are representing the Quote object's QuoteSide's as Tradables, which forces you to cast to QuoteSide in Quote's getQuoteSide method which is
undesirable.

Otherwise no issues, good job!
