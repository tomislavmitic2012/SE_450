FYI - Be sure to watch out for methods (from older or newer project phases) that accept parameters, but no validation is done on the parameters before
they are used. This is not a good practice and can lead to issues ranging from inconsistent application performance, up to crashing the application.
Any method that accepts parameters should first verify the integrity of that parameter data before using it.

(-1) You have a set of non-applicable methods in your Publishers that do nothing - your design results in not-always-applicable methods requiring
implementation in your various publishers. This is not a good aspect of your design and should be revisited in order to rectify this problem.

Otherwise, no issues - good job!
