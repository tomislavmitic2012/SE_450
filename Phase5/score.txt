(-1) You have several methods (i.e., UserImpl's acceptMessage) where parameters are accepted and used without error checking.

Otherwise, no issues. Good job!

FYI - You have a few javadoc warnings:

src\client\UserImpl.java:259: warning - @return tag has no arguments.
src\usercommand\UserCommandService.java:179: warning - @return tag has no arguments.
src\usercommand\UserCommandService.java:199: warning - @return tag has no arguments.
src\usercommand\UserCommandService.java:230: warning - @return tag has no arguments.
